# Tokenomics-Transparency-Suite

Tokenomics Transparency Suite is an open-source project that aims to provide tools for analyzing and visualizing tokenomics data and smart contract code. By combining on-chain metrics and static code analysis, the project helps investors understand the potential risks and opportunities associated with cryptocurrencies.

## Project Goals

- Develop AI models to analyze blockchain data and smart contract code, using techniques like static code analysis and graph neural networks to map token flows and identify concentration risks.
- Provide a risk-rating engine that automatically assigns risk scores to tokens based on factors such as token distribution, contract vulnerabilities, inflationary pressure, and whale concentration.
- Offer simulations to explore different tokenomics scenarios and visualize the impact of changes (e.g., supply schedules, unlocking events).
- Generate narrative-driven alerts for significant tokenomics events, such as large unlocks or contract upgrades.
- Create a user-friendly dashboard to present analysis results to investors and provide API endpoints for programmatic access.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized to separate core code, API, web frontend, and research notebooks:

- **src/** – Core Python code for AI models, data processing, and smart contract analysis.
- **api/** – FastAPI backend that serves risk scores, tokenomics data, and simulation results.
- **web/** – React frontend for interactive dashboards and tokenomics simulators.
- **notebooks/** – Research notebooks for exploratory data analysis, model training, and experiments.
- **.github/workflows/** – Continuous integration and documentation generation pipelines.
